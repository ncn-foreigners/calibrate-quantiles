\title{Function for the balancing control to treatment groups using \code{joint_calib}}
\usage{
joint_calib_att(
  formula_means = NULL,
  formula_quantiles = NULL,
  treatment = NULL,
  data,
  probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_means}{a formula with variables to be balanced at means,}

\item{formula_quantiles}{a formula with variables to be balanced at quantiles,}

\item{treatment}{a formula with treatment indicator}

\item{data}{a data.frame with variables,}

\item{probs}{a vector or a named list with quantiles to be balanced,}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to \code{joint_calib} function.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with containing:\cr
\itemize{
\item{\code{g} -- g-weight that sums up to sample size,}
\item{\code{Xs} -- matrix used for calibration (i.e. Intercept, X and X_q transformed for calibration of quantiles),}
\item{\code{totals} -- a vector of totals (i.e. \code{N}, \code{pop_totals} and \code{pop_quantiles}),}
\item{\code{method} -- selected method,}
\item{\code{backend} -- selected backend.}
}
}
\description{
\code{joint_calib} allows joint calibration of totals and quantiles. It provides a user-friendly interface that includes the specification of variables in formula notation, a vector of population totals, a list of quantiles, and a variety of backends and methods.
