Description: A small package containing functions to perform a joint calibration of totals and quantiles. The calibration for totals is based on Deville and Särndal (1992) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1992.10475217>, the calibration for quantiles is based on Harms and Duchesne (2006) <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/12-001-X20060019255>. The package uses standard calibration via 'survey', 'sampling' or 'laeken' packages. In addition, entropy balancing via 'ebal' and empirical likelihood based on codes from Wu (2005) can be used.
